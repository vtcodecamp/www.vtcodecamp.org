        <p>
            Vermont Code Camp is going to be on hiatus for 2020. While disappointing, we believe
            it is the responsible thing to do. Part of what makes Vermont Code Camp special is the
            sense of community our attendees demonstrate during, and outside of, our event. That
            community has grown from our first event of 50 or so people to an event that has been
            attracting hundreds of attendees each year for the last several years. And we are fond
            of you all. As organizers, we were faced with the challenge of how to host our event at
            a time when we expect limiting the size of gatherings and physical distancing will
            continue to be required to protect our larger community. We considered hosting a
            virtualevent - but decided so many conferences and events are also going virtual the
            need wasn't really there.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so we have concluded the most responsible thing for us, and the community, is to
            cancel our 2020 event.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are optimistic about a 2021 return of Vermont Code Camp and hope you will join us
            then. Until that time, please be well and stay healthy.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Julie Lerman and Rob Hale</p>
